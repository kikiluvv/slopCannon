# 💣 slopCannon 💣
Generate some slop and see what sticks to the wall...

A modular Go tool for slicing videos into short-form clips (yt shorts, reels, tiktok, etc).  

It trims source footage, stacks a minecraft parkour overlay, and exports portrait-mode clips. 

---

## ✨ Features
- Trims long videos into smaller clips
- Outputs vertical 1080x1920 format
- Overlays minecraft (or any background video) on bottom half
- Bundles `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` for easy cross-platform use
- Modular design for future processing steps

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Build
```sh
go build ./cmd/slopCannon
```

### 2. Run
```sh
./slopCannon process /path/to/video.mp4
```

#### OR

Run the executable generated by Go (***RECOMMENDED***)

`slopCannon.exe` (Win) or `slopCanon` (OSX/Linux)

Clips will render into an output/ folder next to the binary.
default filenames look like:
```
clip_1.mp4
clip_2.mp4
```

## 📂 repo layout
```
cmd/          ← cobra cli commands
video/        ← processing + rendering logic
assets/       ← bundled ffmpeg + ffprobe binaries
output/       ← rendered clips
```

## ⚠️ notes
- The `assets/` folder must contain `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` binaries.
(Already included in this repo, ~80mb each).
- ffmpeg is heavy — rendering may take time depending on clip length + machine.

## 🛠️ roadmap
- auto subtitle/caption generation
- "most viewed" video byte scraper
- text/image overlays
- audio normalization
- concatenation mode for montages
- presets for different aspect ratios
